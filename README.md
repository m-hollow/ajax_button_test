# ajax_button_test
learning ajax calls with bootstrap buttons, for use in NoirDB

this is a basic django project developed simply to test out implementation of ajax calls for the buttons in NoirDB.
I wanted to learn how to implement this behavior while working on a 'micro' slice of the main project. This functionality
has since been added to the actual full NoirDB project, also hosted here on GitHub.
